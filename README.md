Hey, hi, I used the Latex template to describe my resume. If you are the same android developer and want the same template, then I am glad that I can share it with you https://www.overleaf.com/project/646b0cd26cf5c2bc19273f9b. By the way, to better deal with Latex code, I used ChatGPT. He also helped me choose more concise words and summarize information. For translation, I mainly used DeepL.
