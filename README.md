Hey, hi, I used the Latex template to describe my resume. If you are the same android developer and want the same template, then I am glad that I can share it with you https://vk.com/away.php?to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.overleaf.com%2Fread%2Fpvbwsycqktvf&cc_key=. By the way, to better deal with Latex code, I used ChatGPT. He also helped me choose more concise words and summarize information. For translation, I mainly used DeepL.
